   <h3>The final exam </h3>

   <p> The final exam will include everything from the second midterm. It will also include homeworks 10-12. So, homework 5-12. </p>
   
   <p> As with the previous exams you will need the following: 
   <ul>
      <li> A pocket calculator of any sort. </li>
      <li> A  <em>  <strong> hand written </strong> page of formulas. Front and back </em> 
         <p> If you type it I will have to mercilessly throw it in the garbage -- I didn't like it, but I did do it last year. </p> </li>
   </p>
   </ul>

   <!--
   <p> Last  years final together with the solution is <a href="./lectures/">here</a> and <a href="./lectures/">here</a>. Some othe problems I used on the second midterm and in this years homework. </p>
   -->

   <h3>The second midterm exam</h3>
   <p> The <a href="./lectures/test2_S23.pdf">exam</a> and  the <a href="./lectures/test2_S23_sol.pdf">solutions</a> are available. </p>

   <p> The Grading Scheme <a href="./lectures/test2_S23.pdf">exam</a> and <a href="./lectures/exam2_grades.pdf">results</a> are available.

   <p> The second midterm is on Thursday 4/13. You should bring the following
   <ul> 
      <li> A pocket calculator of any sort. </li>
      <li> A  <em>  <strong> hand written </strong> page of formulas. Front and back </em> 
         <p> If you type it I will have to mercilessly throw it in the garbage -- I didn't like it, but I did do it last year. </p> </li>
   </p>

   <h3> What's on the exam </h3>
   <ol>
      <li> The exam's content is based on Homework's 5-9, focussing on the core of the material.  You are expected to know fundamental things from the first midterm such as the equipartition theorem, and the partition function. 
         <li> Doing Taylor Series <a href="./lectures/html/A2.S2.html">here</a>.</li>
         <li> Making estimates.  The constants you need are <a href="./lectures/html/A1.html">here</a>.</li>
         <li> The course notes go from the <a href="./lectures.html#FirstLaw">The First law</a> through and including <a href="./lectures.html#Partition">Partition functions of rotations</a>.
         <!--
      <li> The Gamma function
      <li> The Gaussian integrals will be given as in
         <a href="./lectures/html/A2.S3.html">as in appendix B.2</a>.  
         -->
   </ol>

   <h3>The first midterm exam</h3>

   <p> The exam and solutions are available <a href="./lectures/test1_S23.pdf">exam</a> and <a href="./lectures/test1_S23_sol.pdf">solutions</a>.

   <p> The Grading Scheme <a href="./lectures/test1_S23.pdf">exam</a> and <a href="./lectures/exam1.pdf">results</a> are available.

   <p> The first midterm is on Thursday 2/23. You should bring the following
   <ul> 
      <li> A pocket calculator of any sort. </li>
      <li> A  <em>  <strong> hand written </strong> page of formulas. Front and back </em>

   <ol>
      <li> The exam's content is based on Homework's 1-4, focussing on the core of the material. 
         <li> Everything in Chapter one of the course notes -- Probability and the Kinetics of Gasses.  See <a href="./lectures/html/Ch1.html">Chapter 1</a> and the lecture <a href="./lectures.html#Introduction">notes</a></li>
         <li> Making estimates.  The constants you need are <a href="./lectures/html/A1.html">here</a>.</li>
      <li> The Gamma function
      <li> The Gaussian integrals will be given as in
         <a href="./lectures/html/A2.S2.html">as in appendix B.2</a>.  
         The generating function technique used in Homework 1, will <em> <strong>not </strong> </em> appear directly on the exam. (But you are expected to know how to relate the mean energy and other moments of energy to derivatives of the partition function.)
