   <h3>Final Exam on 5/17 from 8:00--10:45 in classroom</h3>

   <p> <h5> Basic content </h5>

   <p> As before my intent will be to focuss on the mainstream, i.e. problems
   which were adequately treated in homework. The exam is cumulative
   but with a strong emphasis on material since after the midterm.
   In practice, this means that there won't be an ideal gas engine cycle.
   But, basic notions probabilitiy, flux, solid angles, integration over solid angle,  partition functions, are all fair game. 
   </p>

   <p> The material since the midterm includes</p>
   <ol>
      <li> Thermodynamics and thermodyanic relations. 
         <ul>
         <li> The
       van der Walls gas  as an example that goes beyond the ideal 
      gas. </li>
         </ul>

      <li> Partititon Functions of Simple Systems: </li>
         <ul> 
            <li> Ideal gas, perhaps with internal energy levels.
            <li> Quantum rotational partitions functions, and its classical 
               approximation.
            <li> Paramagnetic systems, work, energy, entropy. Determining 
               the magnetization, susceptibility
         </ul>
       <li> Variable numbers of particles: </li>
         <ul> 
            <li> Simple models, e.g. Hemoglobin (see lecture). Problem
            <li> Ideal gas equilibrium, and the Saha Equation.
            <li> Fluctuations of particle number in an ideal gas
         </ul>
      <li> Fermi and Bose distribution </li>
         <ul>
            <li> Deriving the Fermi and Bose distributions, and Grand Potential. </li>
            <li> The grand partitition function of photons </li>
               <li> Energy and number per frequency interval, energy per 
                  wavelength interval </li>
               <li> Density of modes </li>
               <li> Entropy and free energy of a photon gas </li>
               <li> Flux of photons through the hole </li>
            <li> First quantum correction to a non-relativistic gas 
               of fermions and bosons. </li>
         </ul>
   </ol>
   </p>
   <h5> Calculator</h5>
   <p>
   <ul>
      <li> You will need a calculator. I will write the exam so that I do not need a graphing calculator, but you can bring one if you want.
   </ul>
   </p>
   <h5> Cheat Sheet</h5>
   <p>
   <ul>
      <li> You may bring a  one page  formulas --  hand written, front and back.  </li>
   </ul>
   </p>

   <h5> Integrals, Taylor Series, and Estimates </h5>
   <p>
   <ul>
   <li>  Throughout the course we discussed several ways to do integrals and other bits of mathematics (like the gamma function). We also discussed using Taylor Series. I expect you to know these, and how to use them. A summary of what I consider fair game is <a href="./lectures/integrals.pdf">here</a>. </li>

   <li>  
      I like you to remember constants like hbar so that you get a feeling, and build intuition about what we are acutally talking about.  
      This is important for making estimates. I wrote up a list of the constants that I consider fair game <a href="./lectures/estimates.pdf">here</a>. </a>
   </ul>
   </p>

   <h3> Midterm on 3/22 at 8:00a.m. </h3>

   <p> The grade distribution of the first midterm is <a href="./lectures/exam1_grades.pdf">grade distribution</a>
   </p>
   <p> The exam and its solution as well as its grading scheme is <a href="./lectures/exam1.pdf">exam</a> and <a href="./lectures/exam1_sol.pdf">solutions</a>
   </p>
   <p> The midterm will mirror the homework (Homework 2-7), focussing on the central ideas, and trying to avoid the periphery. </p>

   <p> <h5> Basic content </h5>   
   <ul>
      <li> Probability and probability distributions. Probability on a sphere. Random walk will <em> not</em> be on the exam.  </li>
      <li> The velocity distributions, flux through a hole, pressure, etc. Classical harmonic oscillator </li>
      <li> Basic partition functions for two state systems, and harmonic oscillator. </li>
      <li> The first law of thermodynamics, isothermal and adiabatic  expansions, and engine cycles. </li>
      <li> The second law of thermodynamics. Definition of entropy. Basica problems working with entropy </li>
      <li> Estimates </li>
   </ul>
   </p>
