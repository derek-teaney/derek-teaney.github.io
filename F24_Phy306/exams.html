   <h3>The Midterm</h3> 
   <p> The midterm is on Wednesday 10/30. You should bring the following
   <ul> 
      <li> A pocket calculator of any sort. </li>
      <li> A  <em>  <strong> hand written </strong> </em> page of formulas front and back. Hand written on ipad and printed out is fine. 

         <p> If you type it I will have to mercilessly throw it in the garbage -- I didn't like it, but I did do it last year. </p> </li>
   </p>

   <h3> What's on the exam </h3>
   <ol>
     <!-- <li>  A detailed guide to the exam topics is posted in the <a href="./lectures/exam1_guide.pdf">exam guide</a> --> 
      <li> The exam's content is based on Homework's 1-8, focussing on the core of the material.  The last two problems (problem 4 and problem 5) on homework 8 are not on the exam.

         <li> Everything in the course notes up to,  but not including,  the section on Free energy: see lectures <a href="./lectures.html">lectures</a>:
           <li> Making estimates.  The constants you need are <a href="./lectures/html/A1.html">here</a>, and will <em> not </em> be provided.</li>
       <li> Some mathematics may come up in physical problems</li>
         <ol>
           <li> Change of variables in probability distribution.  
           <li> Basics of Taylor Series you are expected to know -- see <a href="./lectures/html/A2.S2.html">here</a>
            <li> The following <a href="./lectures/integrals.pdf">table of integrals</a> based on the Gamma function and Gaussian integrals <em> will not</em> be given.
                Your job will be to swich to appropriate dimensionless variables so that  you can use these integrals, see <a href="./lectures/html/A2.S1.html">here</a>.
         </ol>
   </ol>
   </ol>

   <h3>The final exam </h3>

          <p> The final exam is on Wednesday, December 11, 2024 from 11:15 A.M. -- 1:45 A.M.  in our classroom ESS 069</p>

   <!--    
   <p> The final is Tuesday, May 7th at 8:00 a.m. in our classroom.  Note the following:
   <ul> 
      <li> This <a href="./lectures/table_of_integrals.pdf">table of integrals</a> will be provided.
      <li> Bring a pocket calculator of any sort. </li>
      <li> Bring a  <em>  <strong> hand written </strong> </em> page of formulas front and back   
         <p> If you type it I will have to mercilessly throw it in the garbage -- I didn't like it, but I did do it last year. </p> </li>
   </p>

   <p> The exam will focus homeworks 7-12. Homework 7 only particle covered (see below) Some material from the previous homeworks is also needed to answer questions on these homeworks: 
      <ul> 
         <li> Entropy changes in thermodynamics, e.g. computing the change in entropy when two gasses mix. </li>
        <li> Phase space and entropy.
         <li> Partition functions of simple systems, both  quantum and classical, as well as computing the entropy and free energy of these systems, e.g. the simple paramagnet. </li>
         <li> The ideal gas (with internal states) and mono-atomic and diatomic gasses.</li>
         <li> Chemical equilbirium and the grand canonical ensemble</li>
         <li> The photon and neutrino gasses</li>
         <li> The degenerate Fermi gas.</li>
      </ul>
      <p> Working through problems of this sort in 1d, 2d, and 3d can be quite helpful.

   <p> The content from homework's 1-7 is needed to some extent, but will not be the focus. Here is some concrete guidance: </p> 
   <ul>
         <li> From homework 7, Entropy changes in thermodynamics, e.g. computing the change in entropy when two gasses mix: no </li>
      <li> Engines: no. </li>
      <li> Equipartition theorem and estimates: yes </li>
      <li> Basic partition functions. The classical and quantum oscillators and their interdependence -- yes. 
      <li> Ideal gas velocity / momentum distribution: yes, but probably more focussed on the end of the course.  </li>
   <p> 
   <h3> Previous Exams </h3>

   <p> Past years did not cover the degenerate fermi gas. This years final probably will. We also covered more about chemical equilibrium. </p>

      <p>  These are past exams. They can be a guide as 
      to what is reasonable. However, homework 1-7 (which 
      is somewhat different this year) is a better definition of the exam content.
