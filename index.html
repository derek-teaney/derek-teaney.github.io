<h3><a name="Overview"></a>Overview and Learning Objectives</h3>

<p>
This is a one semester undergraduate course in thermodynamics and statistical mechanics. Statistical Mechanics is probably the most difficult, and most interdisciplinary courses in the undergraduate (and graduate) curriculum. It starts with <em> all </em> of physics,  and combines this starting point with challenging concepts (at least for me) to make predictions about real things. 
</p>

<p> The structure and tentative order of the course will follow (but not slavishly) our excellent text book by Blundell and Blundell, <a href="#TheBook">see below</a>. We will also draw examples from Daniel Schroeder's (also excellent) book, <a href="#TheBook">see below</a> and Zemansky and Dittman's 7th edition of the 1937 classic textbook on thermodynamics, <a href="#TheBook">see below</a>. Lecture notes of what is discussed in class will be provided. Weekly homeworks will be assigned.

achieve this goal.

   The image below shows the 
   velocity-distributions for a gas of rubidium atoms, indicating the formation a Bose-Einstein condensate. For this and related experiments, Eric Cornell, Carl Weinman, Wolfgang Ketterle received the 2001 Nobel Prize. Left: just before the appearance of a Bose-Einstein condensate. Center: just after the appearance of the condensate. Right: after further evaporation, leaving a sample of nearly pure condensate.  We will discuss Bose condensation at the end of the course.

<h3><a name="Schedules"></a>Schedules and Format</h3>

<p> The course consists of lectures, homework, midterm and final exams, and
office hours.</p>

<br>
<h5><a name="Lectures"></a> Lectures, class meetings, and lecture notes</h5>

<p> The course consists of three in person lecture hours:
 <ul> 
    <li>  Lecture Hours: TuTh 8:00-9:20 a.m. in Melville Library W4550
 </ul>
</p>
</p> <em>  At the current time, everyone participating in this class, must wear a mask/face covering at all times. Any student not in compliance with this will be asked to leave the class!  </em>
</p>

<p>Detailed lecture notes will be given. 

<br>
<h5> <a name="Homework"></a>Homework submitted online: </h5> 
<p>
Homework is a significant part of the course. It will be assigned approximately weekly, and students should expect to spend approximately 10 hours a week on homework. There will be approximately 12 assignments during the semester.  </p>

<p> Homework will be collected online through blackboard. 
Students will need to produce a  scan (of reasonable quality) of their homework, and submit it electronically as a single pdf document. 
Individual jpegs are  not  acceptable and will not be graded. 
For a typical student, the program CamScanner, which can be installed on any
modern phone, is a useful tool to scan handwritten pages and convert them to a single pdf document. </p>

<p> 
Homework will be accepted late, but will
be penalized at 5% per day. 
</p>

<br>
<h5><a name="Exams"></a> The final exam: </h5> 
<!--
<p> The format of the midterm and final exams is not completely finalized:  </p>
<ul>
<li> The current plan is that the final will be online using the proctoring platform recommended by SBU, which will be announced at a later date. 

<li> The current plan is that the midterm exam will also be an online exam in roughly the middle of October. The exam will be proctored via Zoom, or other mechanism.  The midterm will be two hours in duration, and will (ideally) overlap with our scheduled class period.

<li> I reserve the right to change the structure of the exams, depending 
on the evolving covid-19 pandemic and best practices. Other formats being considered are a 24 hour take home exam, and/or an oral exam.
</ul>
</p>
--!>

<p> The final exam is on Tuesday, May 17th, 2022 from 8:00 A.M. -- 10:45 A.M. in our class room
</p>

<p> The precise date for the Midterm will be established at a later time. 
</p>

<br> 
 <h5><a name="OfficeHours"></a>Office Hours: </h5>
<p> Office hours are 3:00pm on Wednessday either in the the Nuclear Theory Common room (C134) or in my office (C135). You can stop by at other times, but I could be busy. 
<p> Our TA Wenhan Guo will hold office hours at 1:00pm on Tuesdays. The location of the office hours is  at the table and blackboard across from C142B, at the end of the hallway which also includes my office. You can also reach out to Wenhan for meetings at other times, but of course he could be busy too.


<br> 
<h5><a name="Tech"></a> Technical requirements: </a></h5>
<ul>
   <li>
Students will need to produce a  scan (of reasonable quality) of their weekly homework, and submit it electronically as a single pdf document.  Individual jpegsand other formats will not be accepted.
For most students, the app CamScanner, which can be installed on any
modern phone, is a useful tool to scan handwritten pages and convert them to a single pdf document.  This can be submitted to blackboard.
</li>
<!--
<li>  For joining office hours and the last week of classes, students will need a computer with a microphone, which are compatible with Zoom. </li>
   <li>  For the midterm and final exams the students will need a computer 
      with a camera and a microphone, which are compatible with Zoom. </li>

<h3><a name="GradeDetermination"></a>Grade Determination and Homework</h3>

<p>
The grading will be based  <em> roughly </em> on the following table.  I
reserve the right to change these proportions (within reasonable limits)
as the course progresses to provide the best overall assessment of the class as a whole. My intent of course is to follow these guidelines.
</p>
<TABLE border=0px>
        <TR> <TD> Homework</TD> <TD> 20% </TD> </TR>
        <TR> <TD> Midterm Exam</TD> <TD> 40% </TD> </TR>
        <TR> <TD> Final Exam </TD> <TD> 40% </TD> </TR>
</TABLE>
<p>

<br>
<hr>
<br>
<p>
<h3><a name="TheBook"></a>The Book and Resources</h3>

<p> The required book for the course is </p>
      <ul>
          <li> <em> Concepts in Thermal Physics </em> by  Blundell and Blundell. Features short chapters and many examples. </li>
      </ul> </p>

      <p> Some other books which I used when preparing the course are:
      <ol>
         <li> <em> An Introduction to Thermal Physics </em> by Daniel Schroeder.
            Excellent discussion of chemical concepts and should used in conjunction with 
            any AP chemistry book.  I will draw the problems on chemistry from largely this book. 

          <li> <em> Heat and Thermodynamics </em> by Zemansky and Dittman.  A classic textbook, first published in 1937. As a student I especially appreciated the discussion of experiment. I have the sixth edition.
      </ol>

<h5> <a name="Required"></a> Student Accessibility Support Center: </h5>

<p>
If you have a physical, psychological, medical, or learning disability that may impact your course work, please contact the Student Accessibility Support Center, 128 ECC Building, (631) 632-6748, or at sasc@stonybrook.edu. They will determine with you what accommodations are necessary and appropriate. All information and documentation is confidential.
</p>

<br>
<h5> Academic Integrity:</h5>

<p>
Each student must pursue his or her academic goals honestly and be personally accountable for all submitted work. Representing another person's work as your own is always wrong. Faculty is required to report any suspected instances of academic dishonesty to the Academic Judiciary. Faculty in the Health Sciences Center (School of Health Technology and Management, Nursing, Social Welfare, Dental Medicine) and School of Medicine are required to follow their school-specific procedures. For more comprehensive information on academic integrity, including categories of academic dishonesty please refer to the academic judiciary website at <a href="http://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/academic_integrity/index.html">http://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/academic_integrity/index.html</a>
</p>


    <br>
<h5> Critical Incident Management: </h5>

<p> Stony Brook University expects students to respect the rights, privileges,
and property of other people. Faculty are required to report to the Office of
Judicial Affairs any disruptive behavior that interrupts their ability to
teach, compromises the safety of the learning environment, or inhibits
students' ability to learn. Faculty in the HSC Schools and the School of
Medicine are required to follow their school-specific procedures.Further information about most academic matters can be found in the Undergraduate Bulletin, the Undergraduate Class Schedule, and the Faculty-Employee Handbook. </p>
